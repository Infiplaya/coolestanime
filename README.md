# Coolest Anime Character
[Demo](https://coolestchar.vercel.app)

## What's it about?
This is an app bootstrapped according to the [init.tips](https://init.tips) stack, also known as the T3-Stack.
I decided to build app inspired by Roundest by Theo. Vote for a cooler anime character and see results!

Currently there are 25 characters available, but I plan to add more of them in the future.
I'm searching for the right API to do this. I have tried Jikan one but struggled with populating database the right way due to api requests limit. If you want to help me, contact me!

## TODO

- Add more characters to database
- Improve UI
- Improve readme
- more?
